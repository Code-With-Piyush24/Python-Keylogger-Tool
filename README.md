## üìò Project Overview  
This repository contains a Python-based keylogger developed as part of Task 4 of the SkillCraft Cybersecurity Internship. The application monitors and logs all keyboard activity on the host system, storing captured input in a secure local log file.  

This project serves as a practical demonstration of how keylogging functions at the operating system level and is intended for ethical cybersecurity research and educational purposes only.
