## 📌 Project Overview  
This project is a **Python-based keylogger** created for Task 4 of my SkillCraft Technology internship. It monitors and logs every keystroke made on a system, saving the data to a local text file. The primary goal of this tool is to explore the technical mechanics of keyloggers in the context of **ethical hacking** and **security research**.

---

## 🚀 Features  
- ✅ Records every keyboard input in real time  
- ✅ Stores logs in a local `.txt` file for easy review  
- ✅ Operates silently in the background  
- ✅ Simple interface to start and stop logging  
- ✅ Cross-platform support using the `pynput` library  

---

## 📚 Learning Outcomes  
- Gained hands-on experience with **keyboard event monitoring**  
- Learned to implement a keylogger using the `pynput` Python module  
- Practiced **secure file handling** and **log management**  
- Explored practical cybersecurity applications such as:
  - Penetration testing  
  - Forensic analysis  
- Strengthened understanding of **ethical implications and legal boundaries** in cybersecurity

## 💻 Sample Usage  
To start the keylogger, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python main.py
```
